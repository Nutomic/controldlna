## Description

ControlDLNA is a DLNA and UPnP control point app for your phone.

It lets you play audio and video from any DLNA or UPnP compatible  server in the local network to a DLNA or UPnP renderer.

Additionally, other apps can utilize the MediaRouter API to play their media on a remote device.

Android 2.2 (Gingerbread) or higher is required.
